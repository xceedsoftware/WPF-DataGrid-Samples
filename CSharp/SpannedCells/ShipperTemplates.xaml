   <!-- Using binding in WPF is a quick and easy way to display values in a UI. 
        However, frequently the way the information is displayed is a bit too raw and 
        you'll want to customize it. Converters are good way to do that. The Xceed
        DataGridControl conforms entirely to this WPF structure. You can use Binding,
        Converters and DataTemplates like everywhere else in the Framework. -->
